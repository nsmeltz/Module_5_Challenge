# Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate ride sharing data by city type (urban,suburban,or rural). In this analysis I show a summary of ride-sharing data by city type and a graph of total weekly fares by city type for 2019. 

# Results:
**Summary of ridesharing data by city type**

The above table shows the breakdown of ride-sharing data (total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver) by city type (rural,suburban, or urban). Urban cites have the largest number of rides, drivers, and total fares. Rural cites have the smallest number of number of rides, drivers, and total fares. The opposite is true for average fare per ride and driver (ie urban is lowest and rural is highest)

**Total Fares by City Type 2019**

The above graph shows the total fare (ie the sum of all fares) per week from January 2019 to May 2019 for each of the three city types. Rural total fares are generally the lowest and urban are the highest at any given time in the year. All total fares trends increase until the end of February then the drop off in to early March. Urban and Suburban total fares tend to increase through out the year by about $500. Rural total fare generally remain the same through out the year with some varaition.
